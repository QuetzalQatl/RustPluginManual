# RustPluginManual
A manual that will teach you how to set up and run a vanilla Rust Experimental server
then goes on about installing Oxide, extensions and plugins 
and finally shows how to build plugins in all four supported languages.

Also holds a folder with the examples from the manual
And a folder with a snapshot of all the plugins for Rust Experimental
as well as four files with all the code for each language bundled together for easy searching.
